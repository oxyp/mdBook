# mdBook

This is a fork of the excellent [`mdBook`](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook) with a focus on generating PDFs.

* It uses [changes by @HollowMan6](https://github.com/HollowMan6/mdBook) to create internal links that function correctly in a PDF.
   - When [@HollowMan6's PR](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook/pull/1738) is merged and released, we can use stock `mdbook`. 
* It is used together with [mdbook-pdf](https://github.com/HollowMan6/mdbook-pdf) to generate PDFs.
